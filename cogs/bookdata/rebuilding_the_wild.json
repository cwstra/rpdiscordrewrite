    "Towers & Walls": "Towers & Walls\nTowers and Walls serve as fortifications for a community. Walls go on the outside of the community, while Towers serve as strategic garrisons and lookout points.\nWalls must be in a relatively straight line (with some leeway for following terrain). This means that most towns that choose to surround themselves with walls will have to build at least four of them. Walls are (Rank+1) storeys tall, but their length is simply \u201can entire side of the town\u201d or less. Walls may feature gates, allowing passage to authorized persons at a specific place along the wall. These gates may be closed and locked to secure the wall when passage is not permitted, such as at night or during times of war.\nTowers can be built atop Walls, or on their own, as guard outposts or lookout posts. Towers are ((Rank+1) x 2) storeys tall, and often feature portholes to fire arrows from, and a balcony that allows the placement of siege weapons or regiments of soldiers. Towers are the tallest buildings in most communities, rivaled only by Cultural Monuments.\nCastles can be built by combining an appropriate number of Walls and Towers (typically 4 of each). Castles built within or nearby a town serve as a second line of defense, should the town be taken in war.",

Contents in a Bottle cannot be smelled or tasted unless the Bottle is uncorked. Bottles break when thrown, spilling their contents over whatever they hit, for good or ill. Bottles can withstand most attacks from within; however, if a creature is trapped inside a Bottle, they may be able to break through the glass, or cleverly uncork the bottle from the inside. Bottles have a Defense of (Rank x 3) against attacks from inside and out; if an attack against them does not exceed their Defense, then the Bottle is not broken and its contents are not freed.",

For the next hour, you control that object or creature.\n\nThe size of the inanimate object or creature you can control depends on your Perform skill. If you can play the Command Melody, you can control creatures or objects of 1 meter cubed or smaller - the size of a child, fairy, or Deku. At Perform 4, you can control creatures and objects up to 2 meters cubed in size, allowing you to control Hylian-sized statues and the like. At Perform 8, you can control creatures and objects up to 5 meters cubed in size.\n\nIf you control an inanimate object, the object can animate by using any obvious joints, but does not gain any additional powers or durability. If the object does not have any suitable leg analogues, it can still hop along awkwardly (treating all terrain as rough terrain). You can see through any obvious eyes on the object, or use any other senses that a creature of its shape or description would obviously have - for instance, if you took control of a wolf statue, you might be able to detect scents you otherwise could not.\n\nWhen attacking with a statue, use your Perform Trait in place of Combat, Willpower, and Agility. Typically, Statues have Health equal to ((Rank+1) x 10), and Defense equal to (Rank x 2), based on the Rank of the Materials they are made out of. You may use any weapons the statue obviously has (such as a stone sword, or a mouth with which to bite); treat these as weapons of the same Rank as the Statue's Rank.\n\nIf you control a willing creature, you can use that creature's abilities, equipment, Feats, Traits, Spells, and Techniques. You sense everything the creature does, using all of its senses. The creature's original mind is still present, and also senses and remembers everything occurring around it.

Postmen can deliver mail to specific addresses, such as homes or businesses. They can also deliver directly to a person\u2019s hands, if they catch sight of them on their route. However, no Post Office can deliver to a place it is unaware of, or one that is hidden away or shielded by magic - if a normal person (with directions and proper conveyance) couldn\u2019t get there, then neither can the postman.\nAt Rank 0, there aren\u2019t any actual postmen to make deliveries - the Post Office is simply a place where messages can be dropped off and picked up. People wishing to exchange messages will have to visit the Post Office to receive their mail, or to send replies.\nAt Rank 1, the Post Office becomes capable of making simple deliveries. Their messengers can deliver letters and packages to anyone within a small radius around the Post Office - about the size of a small village.\nAt Rank 2, the Post Office\u2019s effective radius increases, to about the size of a large city, or a village and much of its surrounding countryside. At Rank 3, a Post Office can deliver to most anywhere within a country.\nAt Rank 4, the Post Office is capable of delivering packages and letter to nearly anywhere in the world, by land or sea (or in some cases, air). The postmen will use magical means to make the journey, if necessary. Fantastical realms that are still in the same metaphysical world, such as a kingdom in the clouds or hidden deep in the earth, may or may not be available to deliver to.\nAt Rank 5, these postmen are capable of traveling to anywhere in the world, or any other world, and deliver any message or package within a day. They can shuttle messages between the Light and Dark World, the Twilight Kingdom, or any other worlds your campaign might have.\nA Post Office\u2019s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the Post Office.

However, an Owner cannot then use a rented-out House for their own purposes, including as a place to rest.\nIf a House\u2019s Owner does not rent out the house, they may use it for themselves. This allows them to fill it with their own belongings, customize its colors and furnishings, and to rest there for free. When resting in a House, Heroes restore all of their Burnt and Spent Health, Magic, and Stamina, as well as gaining an amount of Temporary HP based on the Rank of the House.\nHouses include a reasonable suite of furniture to fill the space - so a House always includes a bed, table, chairs, and so on. A House\u2019s owners are free to obtain and use their own furniture, as well.\nAll Houses contain a kitchen, which includes a (non-portable) cooking vessel and a place to have a fire. This means that residents in a House can use it to cook without further expenditure. Houses do not come equipped with a Forge, however.\nHouses can be used to store items, containing (2 x Rank) slots. Each slot of Storage acts just like a slot of Overflow Inventory - any kind of item may go into it, and items that stack may stack as large as they like.\nBe cautious of storing a large number of valuable items or materials in your home - Houses are easier to break into, and are generally less well-guarded, than a Bank of equal rank. Further, the more valuable the goods in the home, the more likely it is that thieves will strike, breaking in while any resident Heroes are away and looting the place. If you have a large number of valuable objects you wish to store for a long time, buying space at a Bank may be a better, safer option.\nHouse Rank\u2013Temp HP on Rest\u2013Item Storage Slots\nRank 0\u20130\u20130\nRank 1\u20134\u20132\nRank 2\u20138\u20134\nRank 3\u201312\u20136\nRank 4\u201316\u20138\nRank 5\u201320\u201310",

In short, playing this song at the right place, or for the right people, may open doors for you, both literally and metaphorically.\n\nA curious feature of this song is its inimitability: even if one hears it a thousand times, they will not be able to replay it by ear. The song must be specifically taught to you, by someone who knows it and is 'in the group'.\n\nIf a person loses the favor of the group the song represents, and the group formally revokes their membership, the offender will be unable to play the song properly - it will be off-key, poorly-timed, and otherwise obviously incorrect.\n\nHeroes may learn multiple versions of this song, each time representing a different group.",

You may ask the sages a number of questions equal to (your Perform rank).\n\nFor the sages to be able to answer a question, the answer must be known by at least one sentient creature, living or dead, who would be willing to share it with your or those allied with you. The sages do not know what will happen in the future, and cannot make predictions any more accurately than a normal, reasonable person could. The sages' answers may not necessarily be easy to understand, but they will communicate to you in a language you know, and will attempt to make themselves understood - if a sage answers with something vague, it is because they themselves do not know the full answer, or because the vague answer is the most truthful or useful answer.\n\nIf your campaign has specific sages, or other mystical, scholarly, or powerful beings that the Heroes have met and allied with, you may instead use this song to 'conference call' them. In this case, no unknown host of sages appear; only sages you have met and allied with will answer your call, though they may also decline to participate if they are busy or indisposed.

They may not be able to accomplish the entire task - often, even when the divine steps in, there is still call for Heroes - but the divine entity will do the best they can to ease the Heroes' burdens and open the path they need to follow.\n\nIf played without need, or without profit to the divine entity, they may take the false summons poorly. Beware the story of the boy who cried Wolfos.\n\nThis song may be learned multiple times, each time targeting a different divine entity. If a divine entity wishes to pledge its help to more than one task, threat, or obstacle, it does not need to teach a separate song for the different tasks - the divine entity may expand the scope of the song's designated tasks, but it cannot limit the scope.",

The Written Books they have available depends on the building\u2019s owners, location, culture, and a host of other factors, as the GM decides. Neither Libraries nor Book Stores sell Empty Books or Ink & Quill sets; to purchase those, visit (or build!) a Tool Shop with the appropriate wares.\nBook Stores sell their Books directly.

Heroes are unable to borrow books from a Library while they have an outstanding late fee. If they fail to return a valuable enough Book for a long enough time, some Libraries may decide to take more drastic measures to regain their property.\nA Library\u2019s or Book Store\u2019s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the Building.
